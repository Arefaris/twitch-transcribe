Small tool to feed twitch clips to chatgpt whisper api and transcribe it. 
This repo includes chrome extension and flask server. 
You will need to install chrome extention using chrome dev tools to run this. 
Create .env file in root directory. 
Env file should look like this "API_KEY=YOURKEY"
After that, run python server.py. 
I did use AI to build this.
